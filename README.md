# Vector High Contrast Theme
The goal of this project is to make a set of vector images to match the high contrast themes of OpenOffice and LibreOffice. This will allow rescaling of the icons for high resolutions displays.

## Why the high contrast theme?
Admittedly, the high contrast theme is not a very pretty theme, however that is what this project focuses on because everyday people with visual impairments use this set to make using open source word processors easier.

##How can I help?
Glad you asked! Just choose an icon and make a svg image that matches that image with your favorite vector editor (we recommend [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)). Once you have finished, add your svg file to the same director as the original icon, with the same name. Make a commit with the description `Added <filename>`. Pull your work often so that work doesn't get duplicated.

##Licensing Info
This is licensed under the Apache license under the assumption that the original high contrast theme is under the Apache license. If the original high contrast theme is under a different license, this project falls exclusively under that license.
